<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey there! The names Kari. I have been learning to be a web developer actively, for a couple days now.
  This is one of the projects that I've been working on. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm 31 
  years old, I have a husband and two wonderful children. Now I love being a mother but I won't sit here 
  and pretend that it's easy peasy. Part of the reason I chose to learn how to code is because being a mother is hard, 
  you always want to do right by your children but it's not easy knowing what that is all the time. For me, 
  doing right by my children is following my dreams, setting a good example for them. Showing them that no matter what 
  life throws at you, you keep going. Keep trying to reach your dreams. And thats exactly what coding is for me, a dream 
  that I will keep reaching for no matter what gets in my way! 
</p>

<p>Okay, so who am I, and what do I enjoy? I love to be silly with my family and laugh a lot. I love, love. I've 
  always been a lover over a fighter. I wish everyone could just get along. We are all people and we all have things 
  we are struggling with. I beleive the world would be better if we could all just work together and help eachother.
  The things I enjoy consist of singing, dancing, drawing, spending time with my family and so far, coding and build projects!. 
  And that just about sums me up!
