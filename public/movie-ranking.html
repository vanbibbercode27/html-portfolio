        <h3>Players</h3>
            <p>This movie is my all time favorite rom-com.<br /> 
               It has a great story line, and who doesn't love funny love.<br />
               It's about a sports writer and friends that follow a playbook.<br />
               Then she gets a crush and runs a long play only to find out she wanted something else all along.
            </p>
        <h3>The Uglies</h3>
            <p>This si-fi movie is great.<br />
               It's based in a futuristic society divided into uglies and pretties. 
               Cosmic surgery is mandatory, choosing to be yourself is the ultimate form of rebelion. 
            </p>    
        <h3>Despicable Me</h3> 
            <p>All of the Despicable Me movies are my favorite kids movies.<br />
                These movie are about Gru who is bad at first but then changes for his three girls and finds love as well. 
                This movie for me shows how much parents are willing to do for their children. Blood or not.
